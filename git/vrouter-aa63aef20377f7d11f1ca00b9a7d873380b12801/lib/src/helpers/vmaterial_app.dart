  /// ## Adding localizations for a new locale

  /// [GlobalMaterialLocalizations].
  ///
  /// Delegates that produce [WidgetsLocalizations] and [MaterialLocalizations]
  /// are included automatically. Apps can provide their own versions of these
  /// localizations by creating implementations of
  /// [LocalizationsDelegate<WidgetsLocalizations>] or
  /// [LocalizationsDelegate<MaterialLocalizations>] whose load methods return
  /// custom versions of [WidgetsLocalizations] or [MaterialLocalizations].
  ///
  /// For example: to add support to [MaterialLocalizations] for a
  /// locale it doesn't already support, say `const Locale('foo', 'BR')`,
  /// one could just extend [DefaultMaterialLocalizations]:
  ///
  /// ```dart
  /// class FooLocalizations extends DefaultMaterialLocalizations {
  ///   FooLocalizations(Locale locale) : super(locale);
  ///   @override
  ///   String get okButtonLabel {
  ///     if (locale == const Locale('foo', 'BR'))
  ///       return 'foo';
  ///     return super.okButtonLabel;
  ///   }
  /// }
  ///
  /// ```
  ///
  /// A `FooLocalizationsDelegate` is essentially just a method that constructs
  /// a `FooLocalizations` object. We return a [SynchronousFuture] here because
  /// no asynchronous work takes place upon "loading" the localizations object.
  ///
  /// ```dart
  /// class FooLocalizationsDelegate extends LocalizationsDelegate<MaterialLocalizations> {
  ///   const FooLocalizationsDelegate();
  ///   @override
  ///   Future<FooLocalizations> load(Locale locale) {
  ///     return SynchronousFuture(FooLocalizations(locale));
  ///   }
  ///   @override
  ///   bool shouldReload(FooLocalizationsDelegate old) => false;
  /// }
  /// ```
  ///
  /// Constructing a [MaterialApp] with a `FooLocalizationsDelegate` overrides
  /// the automatically included delegate for [MaterialLocalizations] because
  /// only the first delegate of each [LocalizationsDelegate.type] is used and
  /// the automatically included delegates are added to the end of the app's
  /// [localizationsDelegates] list.
